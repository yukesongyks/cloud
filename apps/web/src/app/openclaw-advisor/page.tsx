  // the user arrived through the Security Advisor plugin and grant the
  // product-specific signup bonus — without the user ever having a

  // callbackPath never carries the bonus-eligible path for code-less
  // visits, so bonus attribution stays tied to real plugin traffic.

  // value into /users/sign_in.
