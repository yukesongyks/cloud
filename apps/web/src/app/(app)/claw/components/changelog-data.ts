      "Stopped agents from hallucinating fixes that rely on systemd. The base container image ships systemd packages as transitive apt dependencies (so `which systemctl` finds the binary), but systemd is never PID 1 and the daemon is never running. `openclaw`, the gateway, and other background processes are managed by KiloClaw's own controller supervisor. TOOLS.md now documents this explicitly so the agent stops recommending `systemctl`, `journalctl`, or unit files. Existing instances pick up the new TOOLS.md section automatically on redeploy.",
