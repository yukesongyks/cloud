# Contributing — macOS Local Development Setup

This guide walks you through setting up the Kilo Code monorepo for local development on macOS.

## Prerequisites

You need the following system-level tools installed before proceeding. If you already have any of these, skip the relevant step.

### Xcode Command Line Tools

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

### Homebrew

Install from https://brew.sh or from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/releases/).

If Homebrew isn't on your `PATH` yet:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Git and Git LFS

```bash
brew install git git-lfs
git lfs install --skip-repo
```

The `--skip-repo` flag avoids conflicts with the project's Husky hooks. Git LFS is used for large binary files (videos).

### Node.js 24.14.1 (via nvm)

The project requires Node.js 24.14.1 locally (see `.nvmrc`) and accepts any Node.js 24.x runtime in `package.json` `engines`.

```bash
brew install nvm
mkdir -p ~/.nvm
```

Add the following to your `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
# nvm (Node Version Manager)
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh" ] && \. "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh"
[ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm" ] && \. "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm"
```

Then reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### pnpm

The project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as its package manager. Use Corepack so the active pnpm version matches the version pinned in `package.json` (`packageManager`).

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@11.1.1 --activate
```

### Docker

Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) either from the website or via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask docker
```

**Important:** Open Docker Desktop at least once after installation — it configures the CLI tools needed for `docker compose`.

### Vercel CLI (recommended if you have access)

Used to pull environment variables from the Vercel project:

```bash
pnpm add -g vercel
```

### Stripe CLI (optional, for payment testing)

Install it to enable local Stripe webhook forwarding. `pnpm dev:start` skips the Stripe forwarder when the CLI is not installed.

```bash
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
```

## Project Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Kilo-Org/cloud.git
cd cloud
nvm install
nvm use
```

### 2. Install dependencies and pull LFS assets

```bash
pnpm install
git lfs pull
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

#### a. Set up using Vercel

The project pulls environment variables from Vercel. Run these commands interactively (each will prompt for browser-based authentication):

```bash
vercel login
vercel link --project kilocode-app
vercel env pull
```

This creates `.env.local` with all required environment variables.

The KiloClaw pages (`/claw/*`) render the Pylon support chat widget, which requires two env vars to activate:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PYLON_APP_ID` — the Pylon app ID from the Pylon dashboard
- `PYLON_IDENTITY_SECRET` — the identity verification secret used to HMAC-sign user emails

Both are already present in Vercel and pulled by `vercel env pull`. If either is missing the widget is silently skipped, so local dev continues to work without Pylon configured.

#### b. Set up manually

If you do not have Vercel access (typical for non-Kilo-employees), you will need to set up the `.env.local` file manually.

Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`, then update the following variables in `.env.local`:

- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Generate a random secret with `openssl rand -base64 32`
- `INTERNAL_API_SECRET`: Generate a random secret with `openssl rand -base64 32`
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: These must be set to create a fake account. You can use an existing Stripe account or create a new one, and use the keys from Sandbox Mode (formerly Test Mode) here.

Then run `pnpm dev:env`. It derives `apps/web/.env.development.local` and Worker `.dev.vars` files from `.env.local` plus each `.example` template. Re-run it after pulling changes that add local service URLs or Worker env vars.

These changes will allow you to do local testing with a fake account.

### 4. Start the database

The project uses PostgreSQL 18 with pgvector, running via Docker. The compose file is at `dev/docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
docker compose -f dev/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

This starts a PostgreSQL container on port 5432 with:

- User: `postgres`
- Password: `postgres`
- Database: `postgres`

### 5. Run database migrations

```bash
pnpm drizzle migrate
```

You need to re-run this every time you pull new migrations from the repository.

If you want to fully reset the local dev database first, use:

```bash
pnpm dev:db:reset
pnpm drizzle migrate
```

To smoke-test that migrations still bootstrap correctly from a fresh empty database, run:

```bash
pnpm drizzle:verify-bootstrap
```

### 6. Start the development server

```bash
pnpm dev:start
```

This launches a tmux dashboard with the Next.js app and local infrastructure. When the Stripe CLI is installed, it also starts the Stripe webhook forwarder. The web app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

To stop all services:

```bash
pnpm dev:stop
```

## Verifying Your Setup

Run the test suite to confirm everything is working:

```bash
pnpm test
```

All tests should pass against the local PostgreSQL database.

## Common Development Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `pnpm dev:start` | Start all local services in a tmux dashboard |
| `pnpm dev:stop` | Stop the tmux session and all services |
| `pnpm dev:env` | Sync `.dev.vars` files from `.env.local` (see [Worker `.dev.vars` setup](#worker-dev-vars-setup)) |
| `pnpm test` | Run the Jest test suite |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Run the TypeScript type checker |
| `pnpm lint` | Lint all source files |
| `pnpm format` | Format all supported files with oxfmt |
| `pnpm format:changed` | Format only files changed since `main` |
| `pnpm validate` | Run typecheck, lint, and tests |
| `pnpm drizzle migrate` | Apply pending database migrations |
| `pnpm drizzle generate` | Generate a new migration after schema changes |
| `pnpm drizzle:verify-bootstrap` | Create a temporary empty database and verify `pnpm drizzle migrate` bootstraps it cleanly |
| `pnpm dev:db:reset` | Drop all app-owned schemas in the local dev database, recreate `public`, and leave the DB truly empty before re-migrating |
| `pnpm --filter web stripe` | Start Stripe webhook forwarding to localhost |
| `pnpm test:e2e` | Run Playwright end-to-end tests |

## Git Workflow

- Direct commits to `main` are blocked by a git hook. Always work on a feature branch.

## Stripe Webhook Testing

To test Stripe integration locally:

1. Install and log in to Stripe CLI: `stripe login`
2. Start local development: `pnpm dev:start`
3. The dev launcher starts the webhook forwarder and writes `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to `apps/web/.env.development.local`.

If the Stripe CLI is not installed, `pnpm dev:start` skips webhook forwarding. To run only the webhook forwarder manually, use `pnpm --filter web stripe`.

## Database Schema Changes

1. Edit the schema in `packages/db/src/schema.ts`
2. Generate a migration: `pnpm drizzle generate`
3. Apply it: `pnpm drizzle migrate`

## Nix Alternative

If you prefer [Nix](https://nixos.org/), the project includes a `flake.nix` with a dev shell that provides all required tools. With [direnv](https://direnv.net/) installed, the `.envrc` file will automatically activate the Nix environment when you enter the project directory.

## Fake Login (Local Authentication)

In local development, you can sign in without real OAuth by navigating to:

```
http://localhost:3000/users/sign_in?fakeUser=<email>
```

This creates a local-only user with the `@@fake@@` hosted domain. You can append `callbackPath` to go directly to a page after login:

```
http://localhost:3000/users/sign_in?fakeUser=someone@example.com&callbackPath=/profile
```

### Admin access

Some features (e.g., admin panels) are only visible to users with `is_admin = true`. The admin flag is set at user-creation time based on the email address:

- **Real OAuth:** emails ending in `@kilocode.ai` with the `kilocode.ai` hosted domain are admins.
- **Fake login:** emails must end in `@admin.example.com` to get admin access.

To sign in as a fake admin:

```
http://localhost:3000/users/sign_in?fakeUser=yourname@admin.example.com
```

A non-`@admin.example.com` email (e.g., `someone@kilocode.ai`) used via fake login will **not** be an admin, because the fake-login provider sets `hosted_domain` to `@@fake@@`, not `kilocode.ai`.

## Organizations & Enterprise Trials

New organizations start with a 30-day enterprise trial. After expiry, the UI progressively locks down: first a soft lock (read-only with dismiss option), then a hard lock (no access without subscribing). This can be inconvenient in local development.

### Using the built-in dev organization

The easiest approach is to use the pre-configured dev organization. While signed in, run the following in the browser console (the endpoint is POST-only):

```js
fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/dev/create-kilocode-org', { method: 'POST' })
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log);
```

This creates a "Kilocode Local" org (`id: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`) with:

- `plan: 'enterprise'`
- `require_seats: false` — bypasses all trial/subscription checks
- `free_trial_end_at: '9999-12-31'` — effectively never expires

### Making any organization never expire

If you've already created an organization and want to prevent its trial from expiring, you have two options:

**Option A: Set `require_seats` to `false` in the database**

This is the most reliable bypass — it short-circuits all trial enforcement (server-side middleware, client-side UI, and login redirects):

```sql
UPDATE organizations SET require_seats = false WHERE id = '<your-org-id>';
```

**Option B: Use the admin panel**

1. Sign in as a fake admin (`yourname@admin.example.com`)
2. Open the admin panel from the account dropdown in the top-right corner
3. Find your organization and either:
   - Set `free_trial_end_at` to a far-future date
   - Toggle on `suppress_trial_messaging` (hides all trial UI)

### How trial enforcement works

Trial status is checked at three layers:

| Layer | Mechanism | Bypassed by `require_seats = false` |
|---|---|---|
| tRPC mutations | `requireActiveSubscriptionOrTrial()` middleware throws `FORBIDDEN` on hard expiry | Yes |
| Login redirect | `isOrganizationHardLocked()` redirects to `/profile` | Yes |
| Client UI | `OrganizationTrialWrapper` shows banners and lock dialogs | Yes |

### Test organizations with various trial states

A script creates 6 organizations with different trial states for UI testing:

```bash
pnpm --filter web script:run db create-trial-test-orgs yourname@admin.example.com
```

## Cloudflare Workers & AI Inference

The application consists of the Next.js app plus several Cloudflare Worker services (see `pnpm-workspace.yaml`). In local development, most day-to-day work only requires the Next.js app and PostgreSQL — workers are started individually as needed.

### AI / model inference

AI inference works locally without any extra services. The Next.js app includes an OpenRouter proxy route (`/api/openrouter/[...path]`) that calls real AI providers using API keys from `.env.local`. There are no mocks or local stubs — all inference hits real APIs (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, etc.).

### Running workers locally

Each worker in the workspace can be started individually with `wrangler dev` (or `pnpm dev`) from its directory. Workers communicate with Next.js over HTTP using env vars like `CLOUD_AGENT_API_URL`, `CODE_REVIEW_WORKER_URL`, etc. Dev ports are defined in each worker's `wrangler.jsonc`.

The easiest way to run workers is with `pnpm dev:start` (see [Common Development Commands](#common-development-commands)), which starts groups of related services in a tmux dashboard.

### KiloClaw local setup

KiloClaw uses `docker-local` by default for local development — no Fly.io access required. To set it up:

1. Expose the Docker socket over loopback: `socat TCP-LISTEN:23750,bind=127.0.0.1,reuseaddr,fork UNIX-CONNECT:/var/run/docker.sock`
2. Build the local image: `cd services/kiloclaw && ./scripts/build-local-image.sh`
3. Run `pnpm dev:env` to create the `.dev.vars` file (already configured for docker-local)
4. Start KiloClaw: `pnpm dev:start kiloclaw`

See `services/kiloclaw/README.md` for more details, including how to switch to the Fly provider.

### Worker `.dev.vars` setup

Most workers require a `.dev.vars` file with secrets like `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `INTERNAL_API_SECRET`. A script automates this:

```bash
pnpm dev:env
```

The script (`dev/local/env-sync/`) scans every `.dev.vars.example` in the repo and `apps/web/.env.development.local.example`, resolves each variable's value, and writes (or patches) the corresponding generated local env file. Before applying, it shows a diff of what will change and asks for confirmation.

Values are resolved using annotations in example env file comment lines:

| Annotation | What it does | Example |
|---|---|---|
| _(none)_ | Copies the value from `.env.local` if the key matches, otherwise keeps the template literal | `INTERNAL_API_SECRET=your-secret-here` |
| `# @override` | Always uses the template literal, even when `.env.local` contains the same key | `# @override` above a development-only bucket name |
| `# @url <service>` | Builds `http://localhost:<port>` from the service's dev port in `wrangler.jsonc` | `# @url nextjs` → `http://localhost:3000` |
| `# @from <KEY>` | Copies the value of a _different_ key from `.env.local` | `# @from CODE_REVIEW_WORKER_AUTH_TOKEN` |
| `# @pkcs8` | Copies from `.env.local` and converts PKCS#1 PEM keys to PKCS#8 format | `# @pkcs8` above a private key var |

For example, in a `.dev.vars.example`:

```bash
# @url nextjs
API_URL=http://localhost:3000

# @from CODE_REVIEW_WORKER_AUTH_TOKEN
BACKEND_AUTH_TOKEN=your-backend-auth-token
```

The `@url` annotation accepts multiple comma-separated services (e.g., `# @url svc-a,svc-b`) and appends path suffixes (e.g., `# @url nextjs/api/events`).

Run `pnpm dev:env` again after pulling changes that add new env vars to any `.dev.vars.example`.

### RSA environment keypair generation

Generate a dedicated RSA keypair when one runtime encrypts environment-backed secrets and another runtime decrypts them:

```bash
pnpm exec tsx dev/generate-rsa-env-keypair.ts -- \
  --out-dir <secure-output-dir> \
  --public-env <PUBLIC_KEY_ENV> \
  --private-env <PRIVATE_KEY_ENV>
```

The command requires a new output directory outside the repository, then writes restricted PKCS#8 private-key, SPKI public-key, and base64 env-assignment files without overwriting existing output. Store `private.pem` and `private.env` in an approved secrets manager and never commit them. Generate a separate keypair for each encryption domain; do not reuse deployment, agent-profile, or GitHub user-token keypairs.

### Local Grafana (reads prod Analytics Engine)

KiloClaw emits events to Cloudflare Analytics Engine (datasets `kiloclaw_events`, `kiloclaw_controller_telemetry`). A local-only Grafana is available for querying those datasets against the real production CF account — there is no local ClickHouse, and `wrangler dev` cannot simulate AE writes, but Grafana can always read what prod has already written.

Grafana is part of the `observability` group in the dev runner, so `pnpm dev:start observability` (or `pnpm dev:start all`) boots it alongside the other observability workers. It shows up in the tmux sidebar under `OBSERVABILITY` on port 4000.

One-time setup:

1. Create a Cloudflare user API token with a single permission: **All accounts → Account Analytics: Read**. No zone, DNS, or write permissions required — this is strictly a read-only token.
2. Add it to `.env.local` (the same file used by `pnpm dev:env`):
   ```
   CF_AE_TOKEN=<token>
   ```
3. `pnpm dev:start observability` — Grafana is available at http://localhost:4000 (default `admin`/`admin`).

The dev runner passes `--env-file .env.local` to `docker compose` when starting infra, so the token reaches the Grafana container via env substitution without being loaded into the runner's `process.env`. Shell exports still override file values.

If `CF_AE_TOKEN` is missing, Grafana will still boot — only dashboard queries fail. The runner prints an advisory warning at startup. See [dev/grafana/README.md](./dev/grafana/README.md) for full provisioning details and dashboard coverage.

### Limitations in local dev

- **Service bindings** resolve locally for Workers launched together by `pnpm dev:start` when the bound target is running. Bindings to optional services remain unavailable unless their owning group is started (for example, session-ingest -> o11y requires the `observability` group).
- **Webhook → KiloClaw Chat** triggers require the KiloClaw worker running on port 8795. The webhook worker calls it via `KILOCLAW_API_URL` (HTTP, not a service binding) to deliver messages to Stream Chat. Stream Chat credentials (`STREAM_CHAT_API_KEY`, `STREAM_CHAT_API_SECRET`) must be in `kiloclaw/.dev.vars`.
- **Cloudflare Containers** (used by cloud-agent, cloud-agent-next, app-builder) always run on Cloudflare's remote infrastructure, even in dev mode. Purely local execution is not possible.
- **Analytics Engine writes** are no-ops in `wrangler dev` — there is no local AE simulator. Reads against the real prod datasets still work via the local Grafana above. **Pipelines** and **dispatch namespaces** don't work locally.

### What works without running any workers

The core Next.js app handles profiles, organizations, usage tracking, billing, and the OpenRouter inference proxy without any workers. Features that require a specific worker (e.g., Cloud Agent sessions, code reviews, app builder) will fail gracefully or show connection errors if that worker isn't running.

### Multi-worktree support

If you use `git worktree` to run multiple checkouts simultaneously, set the `KILO_PORT_OFFSET` environment variable to avoid port collisions between worktrees:

```bash
# Automatic offset derived from the worktree directory name (0 for the primary worktree):
export KILO_PORT_OFFSET=auto

# Or a fixed numeric offset (added to every service port):
export KILO_PORT_OFFSET=100
```

With `auto`, the primary worktree gets offset 0 (default ports), and secondary worktrees get a deterministic offset based on the directory name. The offset is added to the Next.js port (3000), all worker dev ports, and the URLs generated by `pnpm dev:env`. Use the same offset when syncing env values and starting or restarting services in a worktree.

`pnpm dev:start` also passes a worktree-local Wrangler service-discovery registry at `.wrangler/dev-registry` into its tmux session. For worktrees with distinct `kilo-dev-*` session names, this allows concurrent offset Worker stacks such as `agents` to use the same local Worker names without resolving bindings to Workers running from sibling worktrees. The absolute registry path is recorded in `dev/logs/manifest.json` for diagnostics.

Infrastructure containers (`postgres` on 5432, `redis` on 6379, `grafana` on 4000) always bind to their fixed host ports regardless of the offset - they are shared services, not per-worktree instances. Concurrent worktrees reuse those containers, and `pnpm dev:stop` leaves them running while another `kilo-dev-*` session remains active.

## Troubleshooting

### Node version mismatch

If you see errors about unsupported Node.js versions, ensure you're using the pinned Node 24 release:

```bash
nvm use
node --version  # Should output v24.14.1
```

### Database connection errors

Make sure the PostgreSQL container is running:

```bash
docker compose -f dev/docker-compose.yml up -d
docker ps | grep postgres
```

The connection string used by the app is `postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres`.

### Missing `.env.local`

The dev server won't start without environment variables. Run `vercel env pull` to create `.env.local`. If you don't have Vercel access yet, ask a team member for help.

### `pnpm install` fails with engine mismatch

This means your active Node.js version doesn't match the supported 24.x range in `package.json`. Switch to the pinned local version with `nvm use`.

### Git LFS files show as pointer files

If image/video files appear as small text files with `oid sha256:...`, run:

```bash
git lfs pull
```
