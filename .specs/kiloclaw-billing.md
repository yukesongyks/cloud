# KiloClaw Billing

## Role of This Document

This spec defines the business rules and invariants for KiloClaw
billing. It is the source of truth for _what_ the system must
guarantee — valid states, ownership boundaries, correctness
properties, and user-facing behavior. It deliberately does not
prescribe _how_ to implement those guarantees: handler names, column
layouts, conflict-resolution strategies, null-safety patterns, and
other implementation choices belong in plan documents and code, not
here.

When `.specs/impact-referrals.md` grants a KiloClaw free-month reward,
billing fulfillment is still governed by this document's core subscription
invariants. Referral rewards delay the beneficiary's next unpaid KiloClaw
renewal boundary by one calendar month and MUST NOT break Stripe-funded,
hybrid, pure-credit, commit-plan, cancellation, or reactivation guarantees
defined here.

## Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
BCP 14 [RFC 2119] [RFC 8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.

## Definitions

- **Legacy Stripe subscription**: A subscription with payment source
  `stripe` and a non-null payment provider subscription ID. The
  payment provider owns all state.
- **Hybrid subscription**: A subscription with payment source
  `credits` and a non-null payment provider subscription ID. The
  payment provider collects payment; the local billing engine tracks
  the period via credits.
- **Pure credit subscription**: A subscription with payment source
  `credits` and a null payment provider subscription ID. The local
  credit renewal sweep owns all state.
- **Stripe-funded subscription**: Any subscription with a non-null
  payment provider subscription ID (legacy Stripe or hybrid). Used
  throughout this spec to mean "has Stripe billing infrastructure"
  regardless of payment source.
- **Invoice settlement**: The process triggered by a paid KiloClaw
  invoice from the payment provider that converts the payment into
  balanced credit ledger entries and advances the subscription
  period. Defined in Stripe-Funded Credit Settlement.
- **Dunning state**: A non-active payment failure status reported by
  the payment provider (past-due, unpaid, or defensive terminal
  fallback).
- **Credit balance**: The user's available credit balance, computed as
  `total_microdollars_acquired - microdollars_used`. Credits enter the
  system by incrementing the acquired counter (purchases, grants,
  bonuses). Credits leave the system by incrementing the used counter
  (inference usage, pure-credit hosting deductions). The balance MUST
  NOT change as a result of Stripe-funded settlement (see
  Stripe-Funded Credit Settlement rule 3), which achieves
  balance-neutrality by incrementing and then decrementing the
  acquired counter.
- **Credit spend**: Any operation that increments the used counter.
  Both inference usage and pure-credit KiloClaw hosting deductions are
  credit spend. Stripe-funded settlement deductions are NOT credit
  spend; they are balance-neutral bookkeeping entries. Credit spend
  counts toward the Kilo Pass bonus unlock threshold.
- **KiloClaw pricing catalog**: An append-only catalog of KiloClaw
  price versions. Each entry defines plan prices, trial duration,
  self-service instance size entitlement, and payment-provider price
  identifiers for that version.
- **Price version**: The `YYYY-MM-DD` date key for a pricing catalog
  entry, stored on each KiloClaw subscription row as
  `kiloclaw_price_version`. Every KiloClaw subscription row MUST
  reference one known price version.
- **Subscription lineage**: The live chain formed by a subscription row
  and any successor rows created during personal reprovision transfer.
  Price-version grandfathering is lineage-scoped, not account-scoped.
- **Legacy pricing**: The price version for subscriptions created under
  the pre-increase KiloClaw prices.
- **Current pricing**: The default price version for fresh subscription
  rows created after the price-increase rollout.
- **Fraud-enforcement cancellation**: Exceptional immediate personal
  subscription cancellation and suspension required when a personal
  Stripe payment is enforced under `.specs/stripe-early-fraud-warnings.md`.
  It is not a user cancellation or ordinary payment-dunning transition.

## Overview

KiloClaw Billing manages the subscription lifecycle for KiloClaw hosted
instances. Every KiloClaw subscription is funded by credits: a
subscription is a recurring credit deduction tied to a specific
instance. Users access the service through one of two hosting plans: a
discounted six-month commit plan or a month-to-month standard plan.

The recommended checkout path is Kilo Pass, which adds credits to the
user's balance via a Stripe subscription. Those credits fund both
hosting and inference. Users who only want hosting (using free inference
models) can subscribe to a standalone hosting plan via Stripe; the
system routes each Stripe payment through the credit ledger as a
balanced deposit-and-deduction, so all hosting transactions appear in
the credit system regardless of funding source.

Stripe-funded subscriptions are lazily converted to a hybrid state on
their first settled invoice: the system records the payment source as
`credits` while preserving the payment provider subscription ID,
allowing Stripe to continue collecting payment while the local billing
engine tracks the period via credits. The commit plan auto-renews for
successive six-month periods at the same price; users may switch
between plans at any time.

Each subscription is scoped to a specific instance. A user MAY have
multiple instances, each with its own subscription and renewal cycle.
All personal subscriptions deduct from the same user credit balance.
Current organization-managed bootstrap rows remain a temporary
managed-active funding carveout, but their compute lifecycle is still
subordinate to organization trial and seat entitlement.

New users who provision an instance without subscribing first
automatically receive a free trial whose duration is determined by the
subscription row's price version. Legacy
`kiloclaw_earlybird_purchases` rows without canonical subscription rows
MUST NOT mint fresh trial access and instead require manual
remediation. Canonical earlybird subscription rows continue to grant
access until their recorded expiry. Organization-managed instances whose
parent organization reaches the hard-expired trial stage without a paid
or exempt entitlement are suspended with a fresh seven-day destruction
grace; restored entitlement before destruction cancels that deletion and
auto-resumes stopped compute. A periodic background job enforces expiry,
credit renewal, suspension, and eventual instance destruction when access
lapses, with email notifications at each stage.

## Rules

### Plans

1. The system MUST support exactly two user-facing subscription plans:
   commit and standard. A trial plan exists internally but is created
   automatically at provisioning time, not selected by the user.
2. A trial plan MUST last the number of calendar days defined by the
   subscription row's price version.
3. A commit plan MUST cover a six-calendar-month billing period.
4. A standard plan MUST bill on a monthly recurring cycle.
5. The system MUST enforce at most one subscription record per
   instance. Each subscription MUST reference the instance it funds.
   A user MAY have multiple instances, each with its own subscription.
6. The base user-visible price for each plan MUST be identical
   regardless of payment source for the same price version.
   Payment-provider-native promotions, coupons, or other
   checkout-side adjustments are excluded from this parity rule and
   are governed by the payment-source-specific rules below.
7. Stripe-funded billing MUST use configured payment-provider price
   identifiers for the subscription's price version. Credit-funded
   billing MUST use internal microdollar amounts from the same price
   version.
8. The system MUST fail with an error if required billing
   configuration for the selected plan and price version is missing.
   For Stripe-funded billing this includes the payment-provider price
   identifier.
9. Each plan MUST support two payment sources: payment-provider
   (Stripe) and credits. Base plan pricing, built-in first-period
   pricing defined by this spec, access rules, failure handling, and
   suspension/destruction timelines MUST be identical regardless of
   payment source for the same price version. Payment-provider-native
   promotions, coupons, and checkout-side adjustments MAY differ by
   payment source. The payment mechanism and the internal
   implementation of plan switching and cancellation differ by payment
   source (see Plan Switching and Cancellation and Reactivation).
10. Self-service billing MUST NOT expose additional KiloClaw hosting
    tiers or instance-size-based paid plans as part of the current
    price increase. Larger-machine and tiered-pricing selection require
    a future spec change.

### Pricing Versions and Legacy Lineages

1. The KiloClaw pricing catalog MUST be append-only while any
   subscription row references an entry. The system MUST NOT delete,
   reinterpret, or mutate the semantics of a referenced price version.
2. Runtime MUST fail closed if a subscription references an unknown
   price version.
3. The catalog MUST include these self-service price versions:

   | Price version | Effective timestamp | Standard first paid month | Standard recurring | Commit | Trial | Default/max self-service instance |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | `2026-03-19` | 2026-03-19T00:00:00.000Z | $4 (4,000,000 microdollars) when eligible for pre-rollout lineage | $9/month (9,000,000 microdollars) | $48 upfront for 6 months (48,000,000 microdollars) | 7 days | `perf-1-3` |
   | `2026-05-10` | 2026-05-10T00:00:00.000Z | $55/month; no first-month discount | $55/month (55,000,000 microdollars) | $306 upfront for 6 months (306,000,000 microdollars) | 1 day | `perf-1-3` |

4. The current commit plan MAY be described as $51/month, but billing
   MUST charge $306 upfront for each six-month commit period.
5. Every KiloClaw subscription row MUST have a non-null
   `kiloclaw_price_version`. Subscription rows that predate the
   current pricing rollout MUST be classified as legacy for historical
   accuracy, including canceled rows.
6. Fresh subscription rows created after the current pricing rollout
   MUST use the current price version unless they are successor rows
   in a live legacy lineage.
7. A price version is immutable within a subscription lineage. Normal
   renewal, pending cancellation, reactivation before final
   cancellation, Standard <-> Commit switches, standalone-to-credit
   conversion, and live personal reprovision transfer MUST preserve the
   existing price version.
8. Only a live, non-canceled personal lineage can carry its price
   version into a successor row. A canceled historical row MUST retain
   its recorded price version but MUST NOT seed price-version
   eligibility for a later fresh enrollment.
9. A user who fully ends a legacy subscription and later rejoins MUST
   receive a fresh current-price subscription row, not a renewed legacy
   lineage.
10. Price and display calculations MUST use the subscription row's
    price version, or the intended price version for a checkout or
    enrollment that has not created a row yet. Existing live legacy
    subscriptions MUST show legacy prices and legacy instance
    entitlement; fresh current signups MUST show current prices and
    current instance entitlement. Canceled history MUST NOT cause fresh
    subscribe surfaces to show legacy pricing.
11. Self-service default instance size and maximum self-service size
    MUST come from the active or intended price version. Existing
    running instances MUST NOT be actively resized solely because of
    the pricing rollout. Future legacy and current self-service
    provisioning or reprovisioning MUST use the `perf-1-3` baseline
    entitlement. Admin-only overrides are outside the normal
    self-service cap.
12. Existing legacy Stripe subscriptions MUST remain on legacy
    payment-provider prices. Fresh current-price checkout MUST use
    current payment-provider prices. Invoice settlement and plan
    detection MUST continue to recognize both legacy and current
    payment-provider prices.
13. Payment-provider price configuration MUST be date-versioned by
    price-version key, with hyphens encoded as underscores in
    environment variable names. The required self-service keys are
    `STRIPE_KILOCLAW_2026_03_19_STANDARD_INTRO_PRICE_ID`,
    `STRIPE_KILOCLAW_2026_03_19_STANDARD_PRICE_ID`,
    `STRIPE_KILOCLAW_2026_03_19_COMMIT_PRICE_ID`,
    `STRIPE_KILOCLAW_2026_05_10_STANDARD_PRICE_ID`, and
    `STRIPE_KILOCLAW_2026_05_10_COMMIT_PRICE_ID`. There is no current
    Standard intro key. Non-production configuration examples MAY use
    placeholder Stripe price identifiers for local setup, but runtime
    MUST fail closed when a required Stripe price identifier is missing
    or empty.
14. Before fresh self-service provisioning starts, the provisioning
    service MUST resolve the billing entitlement for the user/context
    from canonical KiloClaw billing state. The resolved entitlement
    determines the intended price version and self-service instance
    size for that provisioning attempt. If entitlement resolution
    fails, returns an unknown price version, or conflicts with the
    subsequent subscription bootstrap, provisioning MUST fail or
    quarantine for remediation and MUST NOT silently fall back to
    `perf-1-3` or any other default instance size.

### Payment Sources

The rules in this section govern paid self-service KiloClaw
subscription rows. Trial rows are temporary bootstrap rows and are
exempt from the paid funding invariants in rules 2 and 3. Current
organizational bootstrap rows that grant temporary `managed-active`
access before org billing launches are also outside these funding
invariants. This funding carveout does not exempt them from the
organization hard-expiry suspension, warning, recovery, or destruction
requirements defined below.

1. The system MUST record a payment source for each subscription. The
   value MUST be either `stripe` or `credits`.
2. For paid self-service rows, the system MUST enforce exactly three
   valid combinations of payment source and payment provider
   subscription ID:

   | State | payment_source | provider subscription ID |
   |---|---|---|
   | Legacy Stripe | `stripe` | non-null |
   | Hybrid | `credits` | non-null |
   | Pure credit | `credits` | null |

   A subscription with payment source `stripe` MUST have a non-null
   payment provider subscription ID. A subscription with payment source
   `credits` MAY have a non-null payment provider subscription ID
   (hybrid) or a null one (pure credit). No other combination is
   valid.

3. A paid self-service subscription with payment source `credits`
   MUST record a credit renewal timestamp indicating when the next
   credit deduction is due.
4. At most one subscription record per instance is allowed regardless
   of payment source (see Plans rule 5).
5. User-initiated switching between payment sources is not supported
   for in-place mutation. Users MUST NOT be able to manually change a
   subscription's payment source while the subscription remains
   active; they MUST cancel and re-enroll to change funding method.
   System-initiated conversion from legacy Stripe to hybrid (`stripe`
   to `credits` with the provider subscription ID preserved) occurs
   automatically when a KiloClaw invoice is settled (see
   Stripe-Funded Credit Settlement). This is a one-way lazy
   migration, not a user action. A separate user-prompted conversion
   path exists for users who subscribe to Kilo Pass while holding a
   standalone Stripe hosting subscription (see Standalone-to-Credit
   Conversion).

### Hybrid Subscription Ownership

When a subscription is in the hybrid state, multiple events may
attempt to mutate the same subscription. The following ownership
rules resolve conflicts.

1. Invoice settlement MUST be the sole authority for hybrid-row
   successful payment: advancing the billing period, mutating the
   plan, updating the credit renewal timestamp, updating the
   commitment end date, and recovering the subscription to active
   status. No other event or background process MAY perform these
   operations on a hybrid row.
2. Subscription status-change events from the payment provider for
   hybrid rows MUST be limited to propagating cancel intent and
   dunning states. They MUST NOT overwrite the payment source,
   plan, billing period, credit renewal timestamp, or commitment end
   date. They MUST NOT recover hybrid rows to active status, clear
   suspension state, or trigger auto-resume.
3. Subscription creation events from the payment provider MUST NOT
   revert an already-hybrid row's converted state. The hybrid row's
   payment source, plan, billing period, credit renewal timestamp,
   and commitment end date MUST be preserved. Payment provider
   metadata (subscription ID, cancel intent) MUST still be updated.
4. Schedule lifecycle events (completion, release) for hybrid rows
   MUST clear schedule tracking state but MUST NOT mutate the plan
   or commitment end date. Plan mutation is owned by invoice
   settlement (rule 1). Schedule events and settled invoices may
   arrive in either order; the system MUST tolerate both orderings.
5. The credit renewal sweep MUST NOT select hybrid rows (see Credit
   Renewal rule 1). Hybrid-row renewal is owned entirely by invoice
   settlement.
6. The interrupted auto-resume retry in the billing lifecycle
   background job MUST include hybrid rows. A hybrid row can need
   retry if auto-resume was interrupted after invoice settlement
   recovered it to active (see Billing Lifecycle Background Job
   rule 5).
7. For non-hybrid rows (legacy Stripe or pure credit), all existing
   event-handling and sweep behaviors MUST remain unchanged. The
   ownership rules in this section apply ONLY to hybrid rows.

### Trial Eligibility and Creation

1. A trial MUST only be created automatically when a user provisions an
   instance for the first time. There is no user-facing "start trial"
   action; the trial is bootstrapped during provisioning.
2. The system MUST create a trial only if the user has no existing
   subscription record. The instance-record check is not needed at
   provisioning time because provisioning itself creates the instance,
   but the billing status endpoint includes the instance check as
   defense in depth.
3. When a trial is created, the system MUST record the trial start
   timestamp and an end timestamp exactly the price-version trial
   duration later. Existing trial rows keep their recorded end
   timestamp; rollout MUST NOT shorten active trials.
4. The system MUST NOT require a credit card to start a trial.
5. When a user provisions a new instance and the user's existing
   subscription references a destroyed instance, the system MUST
   create a successor subscription row on the newly provisioned
   instance, provided the current personal subscription row still
   grants access (active, non-suspended past-due, or trialing with a
   future end date). The predecessor row on the destroyed instance
   MUST remain as historical record and MUST be marked non-live via
   `transferred_to_subscription_id`. The successor row MUST inherit
   the remaining entitlement, price version, and any live
   payment-provider ownership. This preserves the user's remaining
   subscription time when they destroy and re-create an instance while
   keeping one subscription row per instance.

### Personal Reprovision Transfer

1. In personal context, the current subscription row is the personal
   subscription row whose `transferred_to_subscription_id` is null.
2. Live personal runtime MUST have at most one current subscription
   row per user personal context. If more than one exists, runtime
   MUST fail closed and quarantine/manual-review the user rather than
   choose heuristically.
3. Transferred-out predecessor rows MUST NOT participate in live
   access checks, checkout duplicate guards, credit enrollment,
   Stripe webhook mutation, invoice settlement, renewal, dunning,
   lifecycle sweeps, or email warnings.
4. Webhook and settlement routing MUST first resolve by Stripe
   subscription ID. If resolved row has
   `transferred_to_subscription_id`, runtime MUST follow predecessor
   to successor until current row is reached. If Stripe ownership or
   lineage resolution is ambiguous, missing, cyclic, or crosses the
   personal/organization boundary, runtime MUST quarantine rather than
   mutate a row.
5. Personal paid flows MUST always carry an instance billing anchor.
   The system MUST NOT create new detached personal subscription rows.

### Access Control

1. The system MUST grant access when the subscription status is active.
2. The system MUST grant access when the subscription status is past-due
   and the subscription has not been suspended.
3. The system MUST grant access when the subscription status is trialing
   and the trial end date is in the future.
4. The system MUST grant access when a canonical earlybird subscription
   row remains in an access-granting state.
5. When earlybird access expires, the system MUST NOT automatically
   transition the user to a trial or any other plan; the user MUST
   manually subscribe to regain access.
6. The system MUST deny access and return a forbidden error when none of
   the above conditions are met.
7. All instance lifecycle operations (start, stop, destroy, provision,
   configuration changes) MUST be gated behind the access check, except
   for provisioning which uses the trial-bootstrap flow.

### Subscription Checkout (Stripe)

1. The system MUST reject a checkout request if the user already has a
   subscription in active, past-due, or unpaid status.
2. The system MUST allow checkout when the existing subscription status
   is trialing or canceled. Checkout from a trialing live lineage MUST
   use that lineage's price version. Checkout after canceled history
   MUST create a fresh current-price subscription row.
3. The system MUST verify with the payment provider that no subscription
   in active or trialing (delayed-billing) status already exists for the
   customer before creating a new checkout session, to guard against
   concurrent checkouts. This check does not cover provider-side
   subscriptions in past-due status.
4. The system MUST allow payment-provider promotional codes for either
   plan. These promotions are payment-provider-native checkout
   adjustments and do not require an equivalent user-entered mechanism
   in the credit-enrollment flow.
5. The system MUST NOT apply a built-in first-paid-month Standard
   discount for fresh current-price checkout. The only built-in
   Standard first-month discount preserved by this spec is for an
   eligible live lineage that started before rollout and whose price
   version defines an intro price. A user qualifies within that
   lineage when no prior paid KiloClaw subscription exists; trial-only
   history in that lineage MUST NOT count as a prior paid
   subscription. The discount amount and the subsequent recurring price
   MUST come from that lineage's price version. Current-price checkout
   MUST use the current recurring Standard price from the first paid
   period. The implementation MAY use a dedicated intro price or
   another provider-supported mechanism that keeps user-entered
   promotional codes available for eligible pre-rollout lineages.
   Intro-price schedule repair MUST be version-aware: recognized intro
   prices repair only to recurring Standard prices for the same price
   version. The system MUST NOT create fresh current checkout sessions
   with a retired current intro price.
6. When a configurable billing start date is set and is in the future,
   the system MUST create the subscription with a delayed billing period
   that begins on that date.
7. When the billing start date is unset or is in the past, the system
   MUST start billing immediately with no delayed period.
8. The system SHOULD include referral tracking data in checkout sessions
   when a referral cookie is present.
9. The system SHOULD attempt to expire open checkout sessions tagged as
   KiloClaw before creating a new checkout session, so users who
   abandoned a previous checkout can start fresh. Expiration is
   best-effort: errors from the payment provider (e.g. the session was
   already expired or completed) MUST be swallowed. Duplicate open
   sessions from concurrent requests are tolerable because each requires
   independent user action to complete, and rule 3 prevents duplicate
   subscriptions.
10. After a Stripe checkout completes, the subscription MUST NOT be
    reported as fully activated until invoice settlement has completed
    (see Stripe-Funded Credit Settlement). Subscription creation from
    the payment provider is an intermediate state; the system MUST
    treat a subscription as fully activated only after settlement has
    converted it to the hybrid state.

### Credit Enrollment

1. The system MUST reject a credit enrollment request if the user
   already has a subscription in active, past-due, or unpaid status.
   This is the same guard as Subscription Checkout rule 1.
2. The system MUST allow credit enrollment when the existing
   subscription status is trialing or canceled. Enrollment from a
   trialing live lineage MUST use that lineage's price version.
   Enrollment after canceled history MUST create a fresh current-price
   subscription row.
3. The system MUST NOT apply a built-in first-paid-month Standard
   discount for fresh current-price credit enrollment. It MUST apply a
   first-paid-month discounted Standard price only when enrolling an
   eligible live lineage that started before rollout and whose price
   version defines an intro price. This rule does not attempt to mirror
   user-entered payment-provider promo codes. A user qualifies within
   that lineage when no prior paid KiloClaw subscription exists;
   trial-only history in that lineage MUST NOT count as a prior paid
   subscription. Fresh current-price Standard enrollment and any
   Standard enrollment after prior paid KiloClaw history MUST charge
   the regular Standard price for the intended price version. The
   commit plan has no first-period discount.
4. The system MUST verify that the user's effective credit balance is
   sufficient to cover the first billing period before proceeding. The
   required amount MUST be the applicable price-version amount: the
   standard intro amount if rule 3 applies, the standard recurring
   amount otherwise, or the six-month upfront commit amount for the
   commit plan. The effective balance MUST be computed as the current
   credit balance plus the projected bonus credits the user would earn
   from the deduction. The projected bonus MUST be obtained by querying
   the Kilo Pass entitlement system for the bonus that would result
   from the deduction amount, without committing any credit award.
   When the user has no Kilo Pass, the effective balance equals the
   current credit balance. When the enrollment is triggered by a Kilo
   Pass upsell checkout flow (see Kilo Pass Upsell Checkout), the
   system MUST account for the credits that will be added by the
   concurrent Kilo Pass purchase when evaluating sufficiency.
5. The system MUST check whether the user was previously suspended
   (has a non-null suspension timestamp) before mutating the
   subscription row.
6. The credit deduction and subscription upsert MUST be performed in
   a single database transaction so that a crash cannot
   leave the user with deducted credits and no active subscription.
   Within this transaction the system MUST:
   a. Insert a negative credit transaction for the first period's cost.
   The insertion MUST use a period-encoded idempotency key (see
   Credit Renewal rule 2) with conflict-safe semantics. The key
   MUST distinguish the instance, plan, and billing period, for
   example `kiloclaw-subscription:{instance_id}:YYYY-MM` for
   standard or `kiloclaw-subscription-commit:{instance_id}:YYYY-MM`
   for commit. If the insertion detects a duplicate, the system MUST
   abort the enrollment as a duplicate attempt.
   b. Atomically record the deduction as credit spend (see
   Definitions) by incrementing the user's used counter by the
   deducted amount. This ensures the deduction counts toward the
   Kilo Pass bonus unlock threshold.
   c. Create or upsert the subscription record with payment source set
   to `credits`, status set to active, the price version set to the
   intended version, the billing period set from the current time, the
   credit renewal timestamp set to the period end, the payment
   provider subscription ID set to null, and the instance reference
   set to the target instance.
   d. The subscription upsert MUST clear the past-due-since timestamp
   and set the status to active, but MUST NOT clear the suspension
   timestamp or destruction deadline at this step. If the user was
   previously suspended, those columns are needed as a signal for
   the auto-resume procedure in rule 8.
   If the transaction is interrupted, the database MUST roll back all
   operations so that a retry can re-attempt without the idempotency
   key blocking it.
7. After the enrollment transaction commits (rule 6), the system MUST
   trigger a bonus credit evaluation. This step determines whether the
   user's cumulative credit spend (see Definitions) — including the
   hosting deduction just committed — now qualifies for additional
   bonus credits under their Kilo Pass entitlement and, if so, awards
   them. The user's credit balance MAY be temporarily negative between
   the deduction in rule 6b and the bonus award; other
   balance-observing systems (monitoring, display, renewal sweeps)
   MUST tolerate transient negative balances from this flow. When the
   user has no Kilo Pass, this step is a no-op. If the bonus
   evaluation fails or times out, the system MUST log the failure but
   MUST NOT roll back the enrollment. The missed bonus SHOULD be
   recovered by a subsequent reconciliation process; this spec does
   not define that process.
8. If the user was previously suspended (per rule 5), the system MUST
   call the auto-resume procedure after the transaction commits to
   restart the instance, clear suspension-cycle email log entries, and
   clear the suspension timestamp and destruction deadline. This MUST
   happen after the subscription row is in active state. If the
   process crashes before auto-resume completes, the non-null
   suspension timestamp on an active subscription signals that
   resume is still required; the next background job run MUST
   detect this state and retry the auto-resume.
9. For the commit plan, the system MUST record a commit-period end
   date six calendar months from enrollment, consistent with Commit
   Plan Lifecycle rule 2.

### Kilo Pass Upsell Checkout

Kilo Pass is the RECOMMENDED checkout path for KiloClaw hosting. The
system SHOULD present Kilo Pass tiers as the primary option when a
user activates hosting, with standalone hosting plans as a secondary
alternative.

1. When a user selects a Kilo Pass tier from the KiloClaw checkout
   flow, the system MUST redirect to the Kilo Pass checkout with a
   callback parameter indicating that KiloClaw auto-activation is
   pending. The callback MUST include the selected hosting plan
   (standard or commit) and the target instance identifier.
2. After the Kilo Pass checkout completes and the payment provider's
   invoice has been settled (credits have been added to the user's
   balance), the system MUST automatically enroll the target instance
   in the selected hosting plan via the credit enrollment path (see
   Credit Enrollment). The user MUST NOT be required to take a
   separate activation action.
3. The auto-enrollment MUST wait for the Kilo Pass invoice settlement
   to complete before attempting the credit deduction. The system
   MUST poll or wait until the user's credit balance reflects the
   Kilo Pass payment before calling credit enrollment, to handle
   the race between the browser redirect and the payment provider
   webhook.
4. A Kilo Pass tier MUST be treated as sufficient for KiloClaw
   auto-activation only when the effective credits available from that
   tier and the user's balance can cover the selected plan's first
   KiloClaw charge for the intended price version. The system MUST NOT
   assume all annual tiers qualify, and MUST NOT offer commit
   auto-activation for a tier unless the effective credits cover the
   six-month upfront commit amount. The standard plan MUST also pass
   this sufficiency check for its first charge.
5. User-facing Kilo Pass upsell surfaces SHOULD communicate when the
   selected Kilo Pass tier cannot auto-activate the selected KiloClaw
   plan because the first price-version charge is not covered.
6. All credit enrollment rules (balance check, idempotency,
   transaction atomicity, bonus evaluation, auto-resume) apply
   to Kilo Pass upsell enrollments. The upsell checkout is a
   convenience flow that ends in the same credit enrollment path.

### Standalone-to-Credit Conversion

When a user with a Stripe-funded hosting subscription subscribes to
Kilo Pass, the system SHOULD prompt the user to transition hosting to
credit-funded billing. This section applies to legacy Stripe and
hybrid subscriptions. Hybrid subscriptions already route payments
through the credit ledger but still incur a separate Stripe charge;
conversion eliminates that charge by transitioning to pure credit.

1. The system MUST detect when a user has both a Kilo Pass
   subscription and a Stripe-funded KiloClaw hosting subscription
   (non-null payment provider subscription ID).
2. When this condition is detected, the system SHOULD present a
   prompt offering to switch hosting to credit-funded billing. The
   conversion MUST NOT be automatic; it MUST require user
   confirmation.
3. If the user accepts, the system MUST set cancel-at-period-end on
   the Stripe-funded hosting subscription (both in the payment
   provider and locally). The current billing period continues as
   already paid by Stripe.
4. When the Stripe subscription reaches its canceled state at period
   end, the system MUST clear the payment provider subscription ID
   from the local subscription row, converting it to a pure credit
   subscription. If the row was hybrid, the payment source remains
   `credits`; if it was legacy Stripe, the payment source MUST be
   set to `credits`. The row's price version MUST be preserved. The
   credit renewal timestamp MUST be set to the existing
   current-period-end so that the credit renewal sweep picks up the
   next renewal. This transition MUST happen atomically when the
   payment provider reports the subscription as canceled.
5. After the transition in rule 4, the credit renewal sweep handles
   subsequent renewals as a pure credit subscription, deducting
   from the user's Kilo Pass-funded credit balance.
6. If the user declines or ignores the prompt, the Stripe-funded
   hosting subscription MUST continue unchanged. The system MAY
   re-present the prompt at a later time.

### Stripe-Funded Credit Settlement

When the payment provider reports a paid invoice for a KiloClaw
subscription, the system converts the payment into credit-accounted
settlement. This is the mechanism by which legacy Stripe rows become
hybrid rows (see Payment Sources rule 2) and by which existing hybrid
rows renew.

1. The system MUST identify KiloClaw invoices by matching a line
   item's price against the configured KiloClaw price identifiers for
   all recognized legacy and current prices. Each recognized price
   identifier MUST map to a price version, plan, and Standard-intro
   classification for recognized legacy or retired intro prices versus
   Standard-recurring classification. Invoices with no matching
   line item MUST NOT be processed by this flow. If required invoice
   data (subscription identifier, matching line item, or period
   boundaries) is absent, the system MUST log a warning and skip the
   invoice. A charge identifier is optional because the payment
   provider can emit fully paid `$0` invoices without a charge object.
2. The settled plan, price version, and billing period boundaries MUST
   be derived from the invoice, not from local subscription state or
   wall-clock time. The invoice is authoritative because local
   schedule tracking may have been cleared before the invoice arrives
   (see Hybrid Subscription Ownership rule 4). If the invoice price
   version conflicts with an existing subscription row's price version,
   runtime MUST fail closed rather than silently changing the lineage's
   price version.
3. Settlement MUST be balance-neutral: the system MUST record a
   positive credit entry and a matching negative credit deduction
   in a single atomic operation. The user's visible credit balance
   MUST NOT change as a result.
4. The deduction amount MUST equal the settled invoice amount. The
   system MUST NOT substitute locally defined plan cost constants.
   Payment-provider-side adjustments (first-month discounts,
   promotional codes, coupons, prorations) flow through as-is.
5. Settlement MUST be idempotent. Processing the same invoice twice
   MUST NOT produce duplicate credits or duplicate deductions. When a
   charge identifier is present, the system SHOULD use it as the
   external payment identifier for settlement. When the invoice has no
   charge identifier, the system MUST fall back to the invoice
   identifier so `$0` KiloClaw invoices still settle exactly once.
6. On successful settlement the system MUST:
   a. Set payment source to `credits`, preserving the payment
   provider subscription ID (converting a legacy Stripe row to
   hybrid, or no-op for an already-hybrid row).
   b. Set subscription status to active.
   c. Advance the billing period and credit renewal timestamp to
   the invoice-derived boundaries.
   d. For commit plans, update the commitment end date to the
   invoice's period end. For standard plans, clear it.
   e. Clear past-due state and any auto-top-up marker for the
   prior period.
7. If a scheduled plan change matches the settled invoice's plan,
   the system MUST clear the schedule tracking state atomically
   with settlement. If the invoice plan differs from the current
   plan and there is no matching scheduled change, the system MUST
   treat the settled invoice as authoritative and log a warning.
8. If the subscription was past-due or suspended before settlement,
   the system MUST trigger the auto-resume procedure after the
   settlement transaction commits (see Auto-Resume on Payment
   Recovery).
9. After the settlement transaction commits, the system MUST
   trigger a bonus credit evaluation as described in Credit
   Enrollment rule 6.
10. `$0` KiloClaw invoices MUST still run the settlement path so
    Stripe-created subscriptions can transition out of the
    intermediate Stripe-funded state into the hybrid activated state.
    Revenue side effects that require a paid amount, such as revenue
    analytics or affiliate sale events, MUST apply their own
    `amount_paid > 0` guard and MUST NOT block settlement.

### Revenue and External Reporting

1. When the system emits revenue analytics or affiliate/Impact sale
   events for Stripe-funded KiloClaw payments, reported amounts MUST
   use the settled invoice amount, not catalog price constants.
2. When the system emits revenue analytics or affiliate/Impact sale
   events for pure-credit KiloClaw payments, reported amounts MUST use
   the committed credit deduction amount. That amount is determined by
   the subscription's price version, selected plan, and any applicable
   pre-rollout Standard intro discount.
3. KiloClaw revenue and affiliate reporting MUST distinguish Standard
   from Commit. It SHOULD distinguish price versions or use
   price-version-specific SKU/category values when the external system
   supports them. External commission configuration is outside this
   spec.

### Commit Plan Lifecycle

1. A commit subscription MUST remain on the commit price for its price
   version in the payment provider; the system MUST NOT create a
   schedule to auto-transition the subscription to the standard plan.
2. When a commit subscription is created, the system MUST record a
   commit-period end date six calendar months from the billing start.
   When a delayed-billing period is configured, the six months MUST
   start from the delayed-billing end date, not from subscription
   creation.
3. For legacy Stripe rows, when a subscription update is received and
   the commit-period end date is in the past, the system MUST extend
   it by six calendar months from the previous boundary, keeping the
   subscription on the commit plan. For hybrid rows, commit-period
   extension is handled by invoice settlement (see Stripe-Funded
   Credit Settlement rule 6d); subscription status-change events
   MUST NOT extend the commit-period end date (see Hybrid
   Subscription Ownership rule 2).
4. When a user-initiated plan-switch schedule completes or is
   released/canceled, the system MUST apply or clear the schedule
   tracking fields as appropriate (see Plan Switching).

### Plan Switching

1. The system MUST allow switching between commit and standard plans only
   for active subscriptions.
2. The system MUST reject a switch if the user is already on the
   requested plan.
3. For Stripe-funded subscriptions, a switch from standard to commit
   MUST create a payment-provider schedule with two phases using the
   subscription's price version: current plan until period end, then
   commit (open-ended).
4. For Stripe-funded subscriptions, a switch from commit to standard
   MUST create a payment-provider schedule with two phases using the
   subscription's price version: current plan until period end, then
   standard.
5. For a standard-to-commit switch, the recorded scheduled-plan MUST
   be commit.
6. When a plan-switch schedule reaches a terminal status (completed or
   released) and the local schedule tracking state still references
   the schedule: for legacy Stripe rows the system MUST apply the
   scheduled plan and update the commit-period end date accordingly;
   for hybrid rows the system MUST clear the schedule tracking state
   but MUST NOT mutate the plan or commitment end date (see Hybrid
   Subscription Ownership rule 4). Plan mutation for hybrid rows
   occurs when the corresponding invoice is settled (see
   Stripe-Funded Credit Settlement rule 7). Intentional releases
   (cancellation or cancel-plan-switch) clear the local schedule
   reference before the event fires, so the schedule event MUST NOT
   match those rows.
7. When a standard-to-commit switch takes effect, the system MUST set
   the commit-period end date to six calendar months from the
   transition date.
8. The system MUST allow cancellation of user-initiated plan switches.
9. For pure credit subscriptions, a plan switch MUST NOT create a
   payment-provider schedule. The system MUST record the scheduled
   plan locally and apply it at the next period boundary during the
   credit renewal sweep.
10. For pure credit subscriptions, canceling a plan switch MUST clear
    the locally recorded scheduled plan. No payment-provider API call
    is needed.
11. User-initiated cross-payment-source switching (credits to Stripe or
    vice versa) is NOT RECOMMENDED. Users who wish to change payment
    source MUST cancel their current subscription and re-enroll after
    the billing period ends. System-initiated conversion from legacy
    Stripe to hybrid via invoice settlement (see Payment Sources
    rule 5 and Stripe-Funded Credit Settlement) is not governed by
    this rule.
12. Plan switches MUST preserve the subscription lineage's price
    version. A legacy lineage switching between standard and commit
    MUST use legacy prices; a current lineage MUST use current prices.

### Cancellation and Reactivation

1. The system MUST reject a cancellation request if no active
   subscription exists. For Stripe-funded subscriptions, the provider
   subscription ID MUST be present. For pure credit subscriptions,
   the payment source MUST be `credits` and status MUST be active.
2. The system MUST reject a cancellation request if cancellation is
   already pending.
3. When canceling a Stripe-funded subscription that has a pending
   schedule, the system MUST release the schedule before setting the
   cancel-at-period-end flag.
4. Cancellation MUST NOT terminate access immediately; access MUST
   continue until the current billing period ends. A subscription that
   is pending cancellation remains in its existing price-version
   lineage until it reaches canceled status.
5. For Stripe-funded subscriptions, the system MUST set the
   cancel-at-period-end flag on both the payment provider and in the
   local database.
6. For pure credit subscriptions, the system MUST set the
   cancel-at-period-end flag in the local database only. No payment
   provider API call is needed. The credit renewal sweep handles the
   period-end transition (see Credit Renewal rule 5).
7. The system MUST allow reactivation of a subscription that is pending
   cancellation.
8. On reactivation of a Stripe-funded subscription, the system MUST
   clear the cancel-at-period-end flag on both the payment provider
   and in the local database.
9. On reactivation of a pure credit subscription, the system MUST
   clear the cancel-at-period-end flag in the local database only.
10. Reactivation before final cancellation MUST preserve the existing
    price version. Re-enrollment after final cancellation MUST follow
    Pricing Versions and Legacy Lineages rule 9.

### Fraud-Enforcement Cancellation Exception

1. The ordinary period-end continuation rule in Cancellation and Reactivation rule 4 MUST NOT apply when a canonical personal Stripe payment is enforced under `.specs/stripe-early-fraud-warnings.md`.
2. Fraud enforcement MUST immediately cancel renewal for every current personal KiloClaw subscription belonging to the contained user, including Stripe-funded, hybrid, and pure-credit renewal state. Any Stripe-backed cancellation MUST leave local billing state reconciled with the provider outcome.
3. Fraud enforcement MUST stop or suspend affected personal compute promptly, transition the affected subscription into non-access-granting canceled/suspended state, and assign a fresh destruction deadline 7 days after suspension.
4. Fraud enforcement MUST preserve the seven-day destruction grace and MUST NOT destroy instance data immediately. Remediation during that interval is an audited admin/support path, not automatic payment recovery.
5. Every fraud-enforcement mutation MUST be captured in append-only subscription change history with a non-sensitive fraud-enforcement reason and a system actor.
6. This exception MUST NOT apply to organization-managed KiloClaw subscriptions or instances based solely on an organization-owned EFW; organization warnings remain review-only under the EFW spec.

### Billing Lifecycle Background Job

1. The background job MUST be protected by an authorization secret;
   requests without valid authorization MUST receive an unauthorized
   response.
2. Each sweep in the background job MUST process users independently;
   a failure for one user MUST NOT prevent processing of other users.
3. All errors during sweep processing MUST be captured for monitoring.
4. The credit renewal sweep MUST run before all other sweeps so that
   pure credit subscriptions are renewed (or marked past-due, or
   canceled) before the existing sweeps evaluate expiry and suspension.
   Hybrid rows are excluded from the credit renewal sweep (see Credit
   Renewal rule 1); their renewal is handled by invoice settlement.
5. The background job MUST detect subscriptions with payment source
   `credits` (both hybrid and pure credit) in active status that
   still have a non-null suspension timestamp (indicating a prior
   auto-resume was interrupted) and retry the auto-resume procedure
   for those subscriptions. This MUST include hybrid rows; a hybrid
   row can need retry if auto-resume was interrupted after invoice
   settlement recovered it to active.
6. The system MAY run additional background jobs that are not part of
   the hourly lifecycle sweep order when those jobs have different
   cadence or operational isolation requirements. Such jobs MUST still
   follow rules 1–3.

### Trial Inactivity Stop

1. The system MUST evaluate personal trial inactivity at most once per
   day, not as part of the hourly lifecycle sweep order.
2. The inactivity job MUST consider only the current personal
   subscription row whose plan is `trial`, whose status is `trialing`,
   whose price-version trial duration is longer than 1 day, and whose
   associated instance is active, personal, and older than 48 hours.
3. The activity check MUST use qualifying KiloClaw usage from the last
   2 days using the product-approved Snowflake semantics. If the
   activity source is unavailable or ambiguous for a user, the system
   MUST fail open for that user.
4. When a qualifying personal trial row has no qualifying usage in the
   last 2 days, the system MUST stop the instance.
5. The system MUST NOT change the subscription status, trial dates,
   suspension timestamp, destruction deadline, or other billing
   entitlement fields when applying a trial inactivity stop.
6. The operational inactivity marker MAY be cleared when the instance
   is explicitly restarted or when the current personal subscription
   row is no longer both plan `trial` and status `trialing`.
7. The system MUST NOT send an email for a trial inactivity stop.
8. Restart after a trial inactivity stop MUST require an explicit user
   or admin start action; trialing access remains governed by the
   normal access rules.
9. The operational inactivity marker is only meaningful while the
   current personal subscription row remains a live personal trial.
   When that row leaves the `plan = trial` / `status = trialing`
   state — including trial expiry or paid activation — the marker
   MUST be cleared.

### Credit Renewal

1. The credit renewal sweep MUST select only pure credit subscriptions
   where status is active or past-due and the credit renewal timestamp
   is at or before the current time. Hybrid subscriptions MUST NOT be
   selected; their renewal is owned by invoice settlement (see
   Stripe-Funded Credit Settlement). The payment provider's dunning
   process handles payment failure for hybrid subscriptions;
   status-change events propagate past-due state to the local row.
2. Each credit deduction MUST use a period-encoded category key
   with a uniqueness constraint. The key MUST be derived from the
   subscription's credit renewal timestamp (the period boundary being
   charged for), not from the current wall-clock time. The format
   MUST distinguish the instance, renewal cadence, and plan, for
   example `kiloclaw-subscription:{instance_id}:2026-04` for a
   standard renewal or
   `kiloclaw-subscription-commit:{instance_id}:2026-04` for a
   commit renewal.
   The insertion MUST use conflict-safe semantics so that a duplicate
   key is silently ignored rather than causing an error.
   The sweep MUST advance the subscription by exactly one billing
   period per successful deduction. If the subscription has fallen
   behind by multiple periods (e.g., the sweep was delayed), the
   sweep MUST NOT attempt to catch up multiple periods in a single
   run. Instead, each successive sweep run advances by one period
   until the credit renewal timestamp is in the future. This ensures
   each period produces a distinct idempotency key.
3. The credit deduction insert and subscription period advancement
   MUST be performed in a single database transaction. If the
   transaction is interrupted, the database MUST roll back both
   operations so that a retry can re-attempt the deduction without
   the idempotency key blocking it.
4. If the deduction insert returns zero affected rows (duplicate key
   from a prior committed transaction), the subscription update
   within the same transaction is a no-op (same values). The system
   MUST skip further processing for that row.
5. If the subscription has cancel-at-period-end set, the sweep MUST
   skip the deduction, set the subscription status to canceled, and
   clear the cancel-at-period-end flag. The billing period MUST NOT
   be advanced; current-period-end retains its existing value.
   Subscription Period Expiry Enforcement rule 1 handles suspension
   once current-period-end has passed.
6. When the effective balance (as defined in Credit Enrollment rule 4)
   is sufficient for the subscription's price-version renewal amount
   and the deduction succeeds (one affected row), the system MUST
   atomically record the deduction as credit spend (see Definitions)
   and advance the subscription's billing period
   (current-period-start, current-period-end, credit-renewal-timestamp)
   within the same transaction. After the transaction commits, the
   system MUST trigger a bonus credit evaluation as described in Credit
   Enrollment rule 6. The user's credit balance MAY be temporarily
   negative between the deduction and the bonus award. If the bonus
   evaluation fails or times out, the system MUST log the failure and
   continue processing the row; the missed bonus SHOULD be recovered
   by a subsequent reconciliation process.
7. When a commit-plan renewal succeeds and the commit-period end date
   has been reached, the system MUST extend the commit-period end date
   by six calendar months from the previous boundary.
8. When the deduction succeeds and the subscription was previously
   past-due, the system MUST clear the past-due-since timestamp and
   set the status to active.
9. When the deduction succeeds, the subscription was past-due, and
   the suspension timestamp is null (grace-period recovery), the
   system MUST delete the credit-renewal-failed email log entry for
   the user so that future failures can re-trigger the notification.
10. When the deduction succeeds, the subscription was past-due, and
    the suspension timestamp is non-null (suspended recovery), the
    system MUST call the auto-resume procedure to restart the instance,
    clear the suspension-cycle email log entries (including the
    credit-renewal-failed entry), and clear the suspension columns.
11. When the effective balance (as defined in Credit Enrollment
    rule 4) is insufficient, the system MUST first check whether
    the user has auto top-up enabled and whether a top-up has
    already been triggered for the current renewal period. If auto
    top-up is available and has NOT yet been triggered for this
    period, the system MUST persist the durable marker (the credit
    renewal timestamp of the period being charged) on the
    subscription row BEFORE triggering the auto top-up call. This
    ensures that if the process crashes after the payment-provider
    invoice is created but before the marker write would otherwise
    have committed, the marker already exists and prevents a
    duplicate top-up on the next sweep. The auto top-up call MUST
    include a deterministic idempotency key derived from the user ID
    and the credit renewal timestamp of the period being charged, so
    that the payment provider de-duplicates repeated requests for the
    same renewal period. After the marker is persisted and the
    top-up triggered, the system MUST skip the row without changing
    any other state (fire-and-skip). The next sweep run MUST
    re-evaluate the row after the top-up webhook has credited the
    balance. The marker MUST be cleared when the billing period
    advances (successful deduction) or when the subscription is
    canceled.
12. When the effective balance is still insufficient (per rule 11)
    and auto top-up is not available, has been disabled due to a
    prior card decline, or was already triggered for the current
    period (marker present), the system MUST set the subscription
    status to past-due and record a past-due-since timestamp
    (preserving any existing value). Past-Due Payment Enforcement
    rule 1 handles suspension after 14 days.
13. When the effective balance is insufficient and the system enters the past-due
    path (rule 12), the system MUST send a credit-renewal-failed
    notification, subject to the standard email idempotency rules.
    The notification MUST NOT be sent when the system takes the
    fire-and-skip path (rule 11).
14. The credit renewal sweep MUST handle three distinct recovery paths
    in a single pass: active renewal (status active, renewal due),
    grace-period recovery (status past-due, not suspended), and
    suspended recovery (status past-due, suspended). Separate sweeps
    are not needed.
15. When a pure credit subscription has a scheduled plan change and
    the current period has ended, the renewal sweep MUST determine
    the effective plan and price-version cost before the deduction,
    but MUST apply the plan mutation inside the same database
    transaction as the credit deduction and period advancement
    (rule 3). This ensures that a crash between the plan switch and
    the charge cannot leave the subscription on the new plan without a
    corresponding deduction. Applying the plan change MUST:
    - Update the subscription's plan to the scheduled plan value.
    - Clear the scheduled-plan and scheduled-by fields.
    - If switching to commit: set the commit-period end date to six
      calendar months from the transition date, consistent with Plan
      Switching rule 7.
    - If switching to standard: clear the commit-period end date.
      After the plan change is applied, subsequent sweeps MUST NOT
      reapply it (the cleared scheduled-plan field prevents this).
      This rule does not apply to hybrid rows; hybrid plan switching
      is handled by Stripe-Funded Credit Settlement rule 7.

### Auto Top-Up Integration with Credit Renewal

1. The auto top-up flow is asynchronous: triggering auto top-up
   creates and pays a payment-provider invoice, but credits are only
   applied when the invoice-paid webhook fires. The credit renewal
   sweep MUST NOT wait for the top-up to complete.
2. When the sweep triggers auto top-up for a row, the sweep MUST skip
   that row entirely without setting past-due status, sending failure
   notifications, or advancing the billing period.
3. On the next sweep run, if the auto top-up succeeded and the
   effective balance (as defined in Credit Enrollment rule 4) is now
   sufficient, the sweep MUST proceed with the normal deduction. If
   the effective balance is still insufficient, the sweep MUST enter
   the insufficient-balance path (Credit Renewal rule 11).
4. The system MUST enter the insufficient-balance path (not fire-and-
   skip) when auto top-up is not enabled, has been disabled due to a
   prior card decline, or was already triggered for the current
   renewal period (as indicated by the durable marker described in
   Credit Renewal rule 11) and the effective balance remains
   insufficient.

### Trial Expiry Warnings

1. For trials whose price-version duration is longer than 1 day, when
   the trial has 2 or fewer days remaining and has not been suspended,
   the system MUST send a trial-ending-soon notification.
2. When any trial has 1 or fewer days remaining, the system MUST send a
   more urgent trial-expires-tomorrow notification instead of the
   2-day notification.
3. A 1-day trial MUST NOT receive the 2-day trial-ending-soon
   notification immediately after creation; it receives only the
   urgent trial-expires-tomorrow warning when eligible.

### Earlybird Expiry Warnings

1. When a canonical earlybird subscription row's `trial_ends_at` is 14
   or fewer days away and the user does not have another active or
   trialing subscription, the system MUST send a warning notification.
2. When the row's `trial_ends_at` is 1 or fewer days away, the system
   MUST send a more urgent expires-tomorrow notification instead of
   the 14-day notification.
3. The notification's expiry date and days-remaining MUST be derived
   from the row's `trial_ends_at`, not from a globally configured
   earlybird expiry constant.

### Trial Expiry Enforcement

1. When a trial's end date has passed and the subscription is still in
   trialing status (not yet suspended), the system MUST stop the
   subscription's associated instance.
2. The system MUST transition the subscription to canceled status.
3. The system MUST set a suspension timestamp and a destruction deadline
   7 days in the future.
4. The system MUST send a trial-suspended notification.
5. If the instance stop operation fails (e.g., no instance exists), the
   system MUST still proceed with the status transition.

### Organization Trial Hard-Expiry Enforcement

1. Organization-managed KiloClaw instances MUST enter trial-expiry
   enforcement only when the parent organization is in the hard-expired
   trial stage and lacks every qualifying entitlement defined by the Team
   and Enterprise Seat Billing spec: an active subscription purchase,
   disabled require-seats enforcement, OSS sponsorship, or suppressed
   trial messaging.
2. The system MUST NOT suspend organization-managed KiloClaw instances at
   the first organization trial-end timestamp or during the soft-expired
   trial stage while rule 1 is not satisfied.
3. When rule 1 applies to an unsuspended live organization-managed row,
   the system MUST stop the associated instance, transition the
   subscription to canceled status, set a suspension timestamp, and set a
   fresh destruction deadline 7 days in the future.
4. Existing organization-managed instances already past hard expiry when
   this enforcement first runs MUST receive a fresh 7-day destruction
   deadline from suspension time; the system MUST NOT backdate the
   deadline to a historical organization trial date.
5. The system MUST send an organization-trial-suspended notification using
   the organization notification rules below.
6. If the instance stop operation fails (e.g., no instance exists), the
   system MUST still proceed with the status transition.

### Subscription Period Expiry Enforcement

1. When a canceled subscription's billing period has ended and the
   subscription has not been suspended, the system MUST stop the
   subscription's associated instance.
2. The system MUST set a suspension timestamp and a destruction deadline
   7 days in the future.
3. The system MUST send a subscription-suspended notification.

### Destruction Warning

1. When a suspended subscription's destruction deadline is 2 or fewer
   days away, the system MUST send a destruction-warning notification.
2. Before sending a destruction-warning notification for an
   organization-managed subscription suspended by organization trial
   hard-expiry enforcement, the system MUST re-evaluate parent
   organization entitlement. If entitlement has returned, the system MUST
   run Organization Entitlement Recovery instead of sending the warning.

### Instance Destruction

1. When a suspended subscription's destruction deadline has passed, the
   system MUST destroy the subscription's associated instance.
2. Before destroying an organization-managed subscription suspended by
   organization trial hard-expiry enforcement, the system MUST re-evaluate
   parent organization entitlement. If entitlement has returned, the
   system MUST run Organization Entitlement Recovery instead of destroying
   the instance.
3. The system MUST mark the instance record as destroyed.
4. The system MUST clear the destruction deadline after destruction.
5. The system MUST send an instance-destroyed notification.
6. If the destroy operation fails (e.g., no instance exists), the system
   MUST still proceed with the state transition.
7. Destroy request acceptance and provider cleanup finalization are
   distinct. The lifecycle sweep MAY proceed with the local instance and
   subscription state transition once the provider lifecycle owner has
   accepted the destroy request or the sweep has logged the failed
   attempt, provided any unfinalized provider cleanup remains durably
   tracked by the provider lifecycle owner.
8. When provider cleanup is not finalized immediately, the provider
   lifecycle owner MUST retain enough durable state to retry cleanup and
   MUST emit telemetry identifying pending provider resources and the
   latest provider error, if any. A provider 404 for a resource counts as
   confirmed deletion of that resource.

### Past-Due Payment Enforcement

1. When a subscription has been in past-due status for more than 14 days
   and has not been suspended, the system MUST stop the subscription's
   associated instance. This applies equally to Stripe-funded and
   credit-funded subscriptions.
2. The system MUST set a suspension timestamp and a destruction deadline
   7 days in the future.
3. The system MUST send a payment-suspended notification.
4. The 14-day threshold MUST be measured from the time the subscription
   first entered past-due status, not from the last database update.
   For pure credit subscriptions, past-due status is set by the credit
   renewal sweep. For legacy Stripe subscriptions, it is set by the
   payment provider status-change event. For hybrid subscriptions, it
   is set by the payment provider's dunning state propagation (see
   Hybrid Subscription Ownership rule 2).

### Email Notifications

1. Each notification type MUST be sent at most once per recipient per
   lifecycle event.
2. If a notification send fails, the system MUST allow the notification
   to be retried on the next background job run.
3. The system MUST prevent concurrent duplicate sends of the same
   notification to the same recipient.
4. The system MUST support a credit-renewal-failed notification type
   for credit-funded subscriptions. This notification MUST be sent
   when the credit renewal sweep enters the insufficient-balance path
   and MUST be subject to the same idempotency rules as other
   notification types.
5. Organization trial hard-expiry suspension, destruction-warning, and
   instance-destroyed notifications MUST use organization-specific copy,
   MUST NOT reuse misleading personal-trial wording, and MUST route users
   to organization KiloClaw or organization billing surfaces rather than a
   personal KiloClaw destination.
6. The system MUST send those organization trial hard-expiry lifecycle
   notifications to the associated instance user and to organization
   owners and billing managers, deduplicating recipients who occupy more
   than one role.
7. Organization trial hard-expiry notification copy and calls to action
   MUST be role-aware: associated users without billing authority receive
   contact-admin guidance, while owners and billing managers receive
   restore-entitlement guidance.

### Auto-Resume on Payment Recovery

1. When a subscription transitions to active while the subscription's
   instance is suspended, the system MUST attempt to start the
   subscription's associated instance.
   For legacy Stripe subscriptions, this transition is detected by a
   payment provider status-change event. For pure credit
   subscriptions, this transition is detected by the credit renewal
   sweep when a past-due subscription with a non-null suspension
   timestamp is successfully renewed. For hybrid subscriptions, this
   transition is detected by the invoice settlement path (see
   Stripe-Funded Credit Settlement rule 8); payment provider
   status-change events MUST NOT trigger auto-resume for hybrid rows
   (see Hybrid Subscription Ownership rule 2).
2. If the instance start attempt fails, the system MUST log the failure
   and MUST NOT clear the suspension timestamp or destruction deadline.
   Leaving these fields intact allows the background job (Billing
   Lifecycle Background Job rule 5) to detect the incomplete
   auto-resume and retry on the next sweep.
3. The system MUST clear the suspension timestamp and destruction
   deadline only after a successful instance start (or when no instance
   exists to restart).
4. The system MUST clear email log entries for suspension, destruction,
   and credit-renewal-failed notifications so they can fire again in a
   future suspension cycle.
5. The system MUST NOT clear email log entries for trial or earlybird
   warning notifications, as those are one-time events.

### Organization Entitlement Recovery

1. When an organization-managed subscription suspended by organization
   trial hard-expiry enforcement regains parent organization entitlement
   before destruction, the system MUST recover it instead of warning or
   destroying it.
2. Recovery MUST restore the subscription to an access-granting
   organization-managed state, clear the suspension timestamp and
   destruction deadline, clear organization trial suspension and
   destruction lifecycle email log entries, and record auditable recovery
   history.
3. Recovery MUST asynchronously attempt to start stopped compute so a
   restored organization regains a usable instance without support
   intervention.
4. If the compute start attempt fails, the failure MUST remain retryable,
   and the recovered organization MUST NOT be destroyed under the stale
   destruction deadline that recovery canceled.

### Payment Provider Status Mapping

1. When the payment provider reports a subscription as "trialing"
   (delayed billing), the system MUST map this to active status
   internally, since delayed billing is not a product-level trial.
2. When the payment provider reports "incomplete" or "paused" status,
   the system MUST map these to terminal statuses (unpaid or canceled
   respectively).
3. Pure credit subscriptions have no payment provider status. Their
   status MUST be managed entirely by the credit renewal sweep and
   the billing lifecycle sweeps. Payment provider status mapping
   rules MUST NOT apply to pure credit subscriptions.
4. Hybrid subscriptions receive limited payment provider status
   mapping. Only dunning states MUST be propagated from payment
   provider status changes. Recovery to active status, plan changes,
   period advancement, and clearing of suspension state MUST NOT
   be applied from status-change events for hybrid subscriptions;
   these are owned by invoice settlement (see Hybrid Subscription
   Ownership rules 1-2).

### Billing Status Reporting

1. The billing status response MUST include whether the user currently
   has access and the reason for that access (trial, subscription, or
   earlybird).
2. The system MUST report trial eligibility as true only when the user
   has no instance records at all (including destroyed instances), no
   subscription record.
3. The billing status MUST include trial data (start, end, days
   remaining, expired flag) when a trial exists or existed.
4. The billing status MUST include subscription data (plan, status,
   price version, cancel-at-period-end, period end, commit end,
   scheduled plan, payment source) when a paid subscription exists.
   When a user has multiple instances, the billing status MUST include
   subscription data for each instance. Subscription data MUST be
   included when either a payment provider subscription ID is present
   or the payment source is `credits`; it MUST NOT be suppressed solely
   because a payment provider subscription ID is absent.
5. When the payment source is `credits`, the billing status MUST also
   include the credit renewal timestamp and the price-version renewal
   cost for the next billing period so the frontend can display the
   next renewal date and amount due. For hybrid subscriptions, the
   renewal cost is Stripe-determined; the system MUST report a
   price-version plan-based approximation or indicate that renewal is
   billed via Stripe.
6. The billing status MUST include a Stripe-funding indicator that is
   true for Stripe-funded subscriptions and false for pure credit
   subscriptions. The frontend MUST use this indicator — not payment
   source alone — to determine whether to show Stripe portal access,
   payment method management, or credit-specific UI such as the
   top-up flow.
7. When the user has a Stripe-funded KiloClaw subscription and also
   has a Kilo Pass subscription, the billing status MUST include an
   indicator signaling that the standalone-to-credit conversion
   prompt should be shown (see Standalone-to-Credit Conversion).
8. The billing status MUST include earlybird data (expiry date, days
   remaining) only when a canonical earlybird subscription row exists.
9. The billing status MUST include instance data (whether an
   undestroyed instance exists, suspension timestamp, destruction
   deadline, and destroyed flag) when any instance record exists.

### Billing Portal

1. The system MUST allow users with Stripe-funded subscriptions to
   access the payment provider's billing portal to manage their payment
   methods.
2. The billing portal session MUST redirect the user back to the
   dashboard upon completion.
3. The billing portal MUST NOT be offered for pure credit
   subscriptions. The frontend MUST use the Stripe-funding indicator
   (see Billing Status Reporting rule 6), not payment source alone,
   to determine portal eligibility. Hybrid subscriptions MUST have
   portal access for Stripe payment method management. Pure credit
   users MUST be directed to the credit top-up flow instead.

### User Data Deletion

1. When a user is soft-deleted, the system MUST retain
   `kiloclaw_instance` and `kiloclaw_subscription` rows for that
   user. Ownership references and directly identifying user fields
   MUST be anonymized rather than deleted.
2. When a user is soft-deleted, the system MUST retain subscription
   change-log rows as canonical audit history. Any directly
   identifying actor or ownership fields in those rows MUST be
   anonymized while preserving the audit trail's meaning.
3. When a user is soft-deleted, the system MUST delete auxiliary
   KiloClaw billing records whose purpose is operational rather than
   canonical state, such as email notification log entries.
4. Credit transaction records created by subscription deductions are
   managed by the credit system's own data deletion rules, not by
   KiloClaw billing. This spec does not impose additional deletion
   requirements on credit transaction records.

### Changelog

#### 2026-05-28 -- Personal Stripe EFW fraud-enforcement exception

- Defined fraud enforcement as an exceptional immediate cancellation/suspension path for personal KiloClaw subscriptions rather than ordinary period-end cancellation.
- Preserved append-only change history and the fresh seven-day destruction grace while excluding organization-owned EFWs from automatic KiloClaw action.

#### 2026-05-18 -- Organization hard-expiry suspension contract

- Defined hard-expired organization trial state as the organization-managed
  KiloClaw destructive enforcement boundary while retaining managed-active
  funding carveout language.
- Added fresh seven-day suspension grace, warning/destruction entitlement
  revalidation, full entitlement recovery with automatic compute resume, and
  organization-specific role-aware notification fanout.

#### 2026-05-12 -- Retired current Standard first-month discount

- Removed current-price Standard intro eligibility. Fresh current
  lineages use $55/month from the first paid period across Stripe
  checkout, credit enrollment, Kilo Pass sufficiency, UI display, and
  tests.
- Preserved first-paid Standard intro only for eligible live
  pre-rollout lineages whose price version defines an intro price;
  recognized intro price IDs remain for settlement and schedule repair.

#### 2026-05-10 -- Price-versioned legacy and current pricing

- Added price-versioned KiloClaw pricing catalog rules with legacy
  prices ($4 intro, $9/month standard, $48/6-month commit, 7-day
  trial, `perf-1-3`) and current prices (no intro, $55/month
  standard, $306/6-month commit, 1-day trial, `perf-1-3`).
- Defined lineage-scoped legacy grandfathering: live non-canceled
  lineages preserve price version through renewal, pending
  cancellation, reactivation, plan switches, and successor rows;
  canceled history remains historical and does not seed fresh legacy
  enrollment.
- Updated checkout, credit enrollment, credit renewal, Kilo Pass
  sufficiency, Stripe price recognition, trial warnings, trial
  inactivity stop, revenue reporting, and billing status reporting to
  use the row or intended price version.

#### 2026-03-27 -- Credit spend model, subscription reassignment

- Added definitions for credit balance, credit spend, and the
  distinction between pure-credit deductions (which increment the used
  counter and count toward the Kilo Pass bonus threshold) and
  Stripe-funded settlement deductions (which are balance-neutral
  bookkeeping and do not count as spend).
- Updated Credit Enrollment rule 5b and Credit Renewal rule 6 to use
  "record as credit spend" instead of "decrement acquired credit
  balance," aligning the spec with the intent that hosting deductions
  count toward the Kilo Pass bonus unlock threshold.
- Clarified Credit Enrollment rule 6: "cumulative credit spend"
  explicitly includes the hosting deduction just committed.
- Added Trial Eligibility and Creation rule 5: when a user provisions
  a new instance and the existing subscription references a destroyed
  instance, the system reassigns the subscription to the new instance.
  This fixes a bug where destroying and re-creating an instance left
  the subscription orphaned on the old destroyed instance.

#### 2026-03-24 -- Credits-first billing, per-instance subscriptions, Kilo Pass upsell

- Reframed the overview to reflect credits-first billing direction:
  every KiloClaw subscription is a credit deduction, regardless of
  funding source. Kilo Pass is the recommended checkout path.
- Changed subscription scope from per-user to per-instance. Plans
  rule 5 now enforces at most one subscription per instance. A user
  may have multiple instances, each with its own subscription.
- Idempotency keys for credit deductions (enrollment and renewal)
  now include the instance identifier to support per-instance
  subscriptions.
- Added Kilo Pass Upsell Checkout section defining the recommended
  checkout flow where users subscribe to Kilo Pass and hosting
  auto-activates via credit enrollment.
- Added Standalone-to-Credit Conversion section defining the
  user-prompted flow for transitioning Stripe-funded hosting
  (legacy Stripe or hybrid) to pure credit when the user subscribes
  to Kilo Pass. Includes the state transition that clears the
  payment provider subscription ID at period end.
- Credit Enrollment rule 3 now accounts for credits from a concurrent
  Kilo Pass purchase when evaluating balance sufficiency.
- Billing Status Reporting now includes per-instance subscription
  data and a conversion-prompt indicator for users with both
  Stripe-funded hosting and Kilo Pass.
- Lifecycle enforcement sections (trial expiry, subscription expiry,
  destruction, past-due, auto-resume) updated to reference the
  subscription's associated instance rather than "the user's
  instance."

#### 2026-03-20 -- Stripe-to-credits hybrid billing model

- Introduced the hybrid subscription state: `payment_source='credits'`
  with a non-null payment provider subscription ID. Legacy Stripe rows
  lazily convert to hybrid on their next settled invoice.
- Added Stripe-Funded Credit Settlement section defining the invoice
  settlement path.
- Added Hybrid Subscription Ownership section defining which events
  own which mutations for hybrid rows.
- Changed discriminants throughout the spec from payment source to
  payment provider subscription ID presence for: plan switching,
  cancellation, reactivation, billing portal, and renewal sweep scope.
- Credit renewal sweep now excludes hybrid rows; hybrid renewal is
  owned by invoice settlement.
- Payment provider status mapping now includes a limited hybrid path:
  non-active dunning states only.
- Billing status now includes a Stripe-funding indicator.
- Checkout success activation now requires invoice settlement.

#### 2026-03-19 -- Pricing and trial changes

Previous values:

- Trial duration: 30 days
- Standard plan: $25/month, promotional codes allowed
- Commit plan: $54/6 months
- Trial expiry warning: 5 days before expiry

New values:

- Trial duration: 7 days (existing trials keep their original end date)
- Standard plan: $9/month with $4 first month while still allowing
  promotional codes
- Commit plan: $48/6 months
- Trial expiry warning: 2 days before expiry
- 14 existing subscribers migrated to new pricing at next billing cycle

## Error Handling

1. When a background job sweep encounters an error for a specific user,
   the system MUST log the error and continue processing remaining
   users.
2. When an instance stop or destroy operation fails during a lifecycle
   sweep, the system MUST log the failure and proceed with the
   subscription state transition regardless.
3. When a schedule release fails during cancellation with an error
   indicating the schedule is already released or canceled, the system
   MUST treat this as success and proceed with clearing local state.
4. When a schedule release fails during cancellation for any other
   reason (e.g., transient API error), the system MUST abort the
   cancellation and return an error to the user.
