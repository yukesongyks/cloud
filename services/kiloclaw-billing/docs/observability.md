# KiloClaw Billing Observability

## Base Filter

Use this filter for every billing lifecycle query in Axiom:

`billingFlow = "kiloclaw_lifecycle"`

Important dimensions:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `billingComponent` | `worker`, `side_effects`, `kiloclaw_platform`, or `snowflake_sql_api` |
| `billingRunId` | One hourly billing run across all sweeps |
| `billingSweep` | The current sweep name, including `trial_inactivity_stop` for daily coordination and `trial_inactivity_stop_candidate` for per-instance stop work |
| `billingCallId` | One downstream call from the worker |
| `billingAttempt` | Queue delivery attempt number |
| `event` | `run_started`, `sweep_started`, `sweep_completed`, `sweep_failed`, `queue_retry`, `run_completed`, `run_failed`, `downstream_call`, `downstream_action`, `request_rejected`, `subscription_row_skipped`, and trial-inactivity-specific events such as `trial_inactivity_stop` |
| `outcome` | `started`, `completed`, `failed`, `retry`, `discarded`, or `skipped` |
| `durationMs` | Elapsed time for a sweep or downstream request |
| `snowflakeCode` | Snowflake SQL API error code on failed submit/poll requests |
| `snowflakeMessage` | Snowflake SQL API error message on failed submit/poll requests |

## Monitors

Create these monitors in Axiom:

1. `billing-run-failed-before-dlq`
   Trigger when `event = "run_failed"` and `willGoToDlq = true`.
   Severity: page.

2. `billing-queue-retry-spike`
   Trigger when `event = "queue_retry"` count is `>= 3` in 15 minutes.
   Severity: ticket.

3. `billing-downstream-failure-spike`
   Trigger when `billingComponent in ("side_effects", "kiloclaw_platform")` and `outcome = "failed"` count is `>= 5` in 15 minutes.
   Severity: ticket.

4. `billing-run-missing-completion`
   Trigger when a `run_started` event has no matching `run_completed` event for the same `billingRunId` within 75 minutes.
   Severity: ticket.

5. `billing-snowflake-failure-spike`
   Trigger when `billingComponent = "snowflake_sql_api"` and `outcome = "failed"` count is `>= 5` in 15 minutes.
   Severity: ticket.

6. `credit-renewal-terminal-failures`
   Trigger when `event = "credit_renewal_terminal_failure"` and `terminalFailureStatus = "unresolved"` count is `>= 1` in 5 minutes.
   Severity: page.

7. `credit-renewal-item-age-risk`
   Trigger when `event = "credit_renewal_item"` and `itemQueueAgeMs` p95 approaches the past-due enforcement grace window.
   Severity: ticket; page if the age risks false suspension or destruction.

8. `credit-renewal-discovery-backlog`
   Trigger when `event = "credit_renewal_discovery"` and `discoveryBacklogLikely = true` persists across repeated billing runs.
   Severity: ticket.

## Credit Enrollment Flow

The user-initiated "Pay with Credits" flow emits its own logs under a separate `billingFlow` so they can be queried independently of the hourly lifecycle sweep.

Base filter:

`billingFlow = "credit_enrollment"`

Dimensions:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `billingComponent` | `web_trpc` (the enrollWithCredits TRPC mutation) |
| `event` | `credit_enrollment.attempted`, `credit_enrollment.succeeded`, `credit_enrollment.failed` |
| `outcome` | `started`, `completed`, `failed` |
| `failureReason` | `insufficient_credits`, `duplicate_enrollment`, `active_subscription_exists`, `no_instance`, `user_not_found`, `precondition_failed`, `internal_error` |
| `plan` | `commit` or `standard` |
| `userId` | KiloCode user id |
| `instanceId` | KiloClaw instance id (omitted on `no_instance` failures when the user never resolved to an instance) |
| `durationMs` | Time from mutation entry to success/failure |
| `error` | Error message on failures (truncated to 500 chars; may include upstream ORM/driver text on `internal_error` — treat as semi-sensitive) |

Funnel shape: every attempt emits exactly one `credit_enrollment.attempted`, followed by exactly one of `credit_enrollment.succeeded` or `credit_enrollment.failed` (with a `failureReason`). The enclosing try/catch guarantees this even if upstream helpers (anchor resolution, prior-subscription lookup) throw.

Add these monitors in Axiom:

6. `credit-enrollment-internal-error`
   Trigger when `billingFlow = "credit_enrollment"` and `event = "credit_enrollment.failed"` and `failureReason = "internal_error"` count is `>= 1` in 5 minutes.
   Severity: page.
   Rationale: distinguishes real bugs from expected user-wallet rejections.

7. `credit-enrollment-failure-spike`
   Trigger when `billingFlow = "credit_enrollment"` and `event = "credit_enrollment.failed"` count is `>= 10` in 15 minutes.
   Severity: ticket.
   Rationale: catches sustained drop-offs (insufficient credits, missing instance, duplicate-retry storms) regardless of cause. Tune the threshold after one week of baseline data.

## Notes

- The worker is the source of truth for run and sweep lifecycle state.
- The Next internal route and `kiloclaw` logs are correlated into the same run through the billing headers, not through separate tracing infrastructure.
- Do not add recipient emails, template vars, click IDs, or auth headers to logs.
