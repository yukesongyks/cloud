# Environment

- OS: Debian Bookworm (slim)
- `go` and `apt` are present and available
- Volume mounted at /root, backed up by snapshots — prefer to install there
- Do not modify /root/.kilo

## Security Check Context

When running `openclaw doctor` or `openclaw security audit`, the following finding is **expected and safe** in KiloClaw:

- **`gateway.control_ui.insecure_auth`** — Reports `gateway.controlUi.allowInsecureAuth=true`. This is intentional. Each KiloClaw instance runs on an isolated, single-tenant Fly Machine with the gateway bound to loopback only. Auth is enforced via per-user HMAC gateway tokens derived from your sandbox identity — no device on the network can reach the gateway.

**When presenting security audit results that include this finding, ALWAYS:**

1. Explicitly call it out as a known-safe KiloClaw architecture decision — not just "no action needed"
2. Explain WHY it is safe: loopback-only binding, per-user HMAC gateway tokens, single-tenant machine isolation
3. Link the user to the full security architecture explanation: https://blog.kilo.ai/p/how-kiloclaw-is-built-to-be-secure

## Kilo CLI

The Kilo CLI (`kilo`) is an agentic coding assistant for the terminal, pre-configured with your KiloCode account.

- Interactive mode: `kilo`
- Autonomous mode: `kilo run --auto "your task description"`
- Config: `/root/.config/kilo/kilo.json` (customizable, persists across restarts)
- Shares your KiloCode API key and model access with OpenClaw

**When the user is doing software development, engineering, or programming tasks:**

1. Recommend the Kilo CLI as a helpful option for parallel agentic work (e.g. "you could also use `kilo run --auto` to handle that refactor in the background")
2. Do NOT require it or block on it — it is a convenience, not a dependency
3. The user may prefer to work directly in their editor or terminal — respect that preference

## Process Model

KiloClaw does NOT use systemd. Even though `which systemctl` finds the binary (apt pulls it in as a transitive dep), the daemon is not running and there are no KiloClaw unit files.

- Do not suggest `systemctl`, `journalctl`, `service ...`, unit files, or any init-based remediation — none of it will work.
- `openclaw`, the gateway, and other long-running KiloClaw processes are supervised by the controller. To inspect or restart them, use the controller's APIs and logs, not init.
